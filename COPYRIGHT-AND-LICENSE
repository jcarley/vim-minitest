It seems to me, the author, like SQLite is doing it right: https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html.
Consider this code to be dedicated to the public domain by me in the same spirit as SQLite. I don't have all the official contingency stuff (i.e., if someone really wants a license) but if anyone else ever uses this code and wants such stuff, let me know and I'll probably figure it out.
